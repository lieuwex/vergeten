File catalogs
===

.vergeten/staged.db:
```
<file paths separated by \0>
```

.vergeten/things.db:
A file containing all the paths that vergeten tries to remember.
Delimiter is a null byte, denoted by '\0' in this file. The content is as follows:
```
<file path>\0<hash>\0<TODO>\0\0<file path>...
```

.vergeten/things/<relative file path>:
The historical content of a thing is stored in `.vergeten/things/` in its own
relative path. The contents of that history file is as follows:
```
<commit id>\0<file content>\0\0<commit id>\0<file content>
```

Trivia
@Lieuwex wanted to have this way cooler file content history notation than
what vergeten currently has:

```
function () { console.log('hoi') }
aabc\027\0\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7fkaas\032\0;
```
